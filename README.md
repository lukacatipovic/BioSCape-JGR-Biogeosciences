Key Points:
GCFR coastal bays and inland waterbodies have distinct optical DOM dynamics driven by river inputs, land use, and seasonality
Satellite algorithms (OLCI/MSI) validated with in situ data enable longterm monitoring of ag300 and S275-295 in South African coastal waters
Episodic droughts/floods alter DOM delivery by decreasing/increasing the amount of organic material delivered into the bays

Abstract

The biodiverse and rapidly changing Greater Cape Floristic Region (GCFR) of southern Africa is outlined by coastal bays that receive autochthonous dissolved organic matter (DOM) from rivers draining complex catchments composed of natural, agricultural, and urban land classes. As part of NASA's BioSCape field campaign (October-November 2023), we characterized the optical properties of three GCFR coastal bays (St. Helena, Walker, and Algoa), and four inland systems (Rietvlei wetland, Zeekoevlei lake, Theewaterskloof dam, and the Klein River Estuary), in relation to DOM biogeochemistry and carbon cycling. Measurements of the optical properties of colored DOM (CDOM), including absorption at 300 nm (ag300), spectral slope (S275-295), and fluorescence, highlighted the bio-optical complexity associated with terrestrial influences, urban disturbances, intense biological activity, and rapid transformations along this dynamic coastline. CDOM in the coastal bays was characterized by an order of magnitude lower ag300 (0.5 – 2.8 m-1) and considerably higher S275-295 (0.020 – 0.031 nm-1) compared to upstream waters (25 – 71 m-1 and 0.012 – 0.019 nm-1, respectively), suggesting intense biological production and/or photochemical degradation. Coastal DOM was mostly (>75%) composed of protein-like fluorescent products, indicative of bacterial utilization, while inland DOM was mostly composed of terrigenous humic materials and had higher overall fluorescence signal. Satellite retrievals, using Sentinel-3 OLCI imagery, captured the relative influence of different rivers on coastal DOM dynamics and revealed that episodic events - extended periods of drought punctuated by heavy precipitation - are the primary drivers of biogeochemical variability along this globally significant, coastal biodiversity hotspot.


Plain Language Summary

South African coastal waters experience drastic changes in response to human activity and episodic events, which in turn can affect the biodiversity and biogeochemistry of these waters. Both inland and coastal water bodies receive organic material from surrounding land, and the type of land (agricultural, urban, or natural) affects the optical properties of this input. These unique optical characteristics warrant the development of regional algorithms for estimating these properties using satellite sensors. Satellite remote sensing is a key Earth observational tool for assessing changes in the amount and type of organic material in these waters. This study examines the seasonal delivery of organic material in St. Helena Bay, Walker Bay, and Algoa Bay within the Greater Cape Floristic Region, South Africa. We found that across three bays whose watersheds had varying land classifications, river floods in the austral winter brought large amounts of organic material to the coastal waters. The quality of said organic material was influenced by both the volume of river discharge as well as the composition of the watersheds. These findings highlight how land use and climate extremes impact coastal waters, with implications for future monitoring of this ecologically biodiverse region.
